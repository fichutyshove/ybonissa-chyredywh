Overview
&quot;A beautifully gruesome detailing of two peculiar people.&quot; It&#039;s nearly Halloween, the sky won&#039;t stop weeping and from the guts of Olympia&#039;s Eden Valley Psychiatric Unit emerges nineteen-year-old Leo Welch, staggering blindly into the streets of an unfamiliar city where her only company is a peculiar roommate, her two eldest children and a bizarre collection of ladybug figurines. Jobless, pill-reliant and emotionally wounded, a life spent with one eye glaring at the past and the other squinting fearfully at the future is all Leo knows-until she meets fellow ex-inpatient Elowen Reeves, a mysterious drifter who swiftly captures Leo&#039;s attention and emboldens her resentment towards the monster who destroyed her life in Ely. When a sudden, horrific event shatters Leo&#039;s image of her unusual new friend and sends them both on a dizzying road trip across the American West, Leo must finally face a choice she&#039;s spent years ducking from-allow the pain to consume her once and for all, or dive headfirst into the underbelly of her Nevadan hometown to kill her demons before they can get another stab at killing her.
