Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Using his knack for page-turning suspense, John Grisham teams up with Jim McCloskey to deliver a stark indictment of the flaws in our justice system, centering on a collection of true stories of wrongly convicted individuals and their battles for freedom. In John Grisham‚Äôs first work of nonfiction since The Innocent Man, ‚Äúthe master of the legal thriller‚Äù (Associated Press) teams up with Jim McCloskey, ‚Äúthe godfather of the innocence movement‚Äù (Texas Monthly), to share ten harrowing true stories of wrongful convictions.
 
 ‚ÄúEach of these stories is told with astonishing power. They are packed with human drama, with acts of shocking villainy and breathtaking courage. But these are more than just gripping true stories‚Äîthey are a clarion call for reforming the tragic flaws in our criminal justice system.‚Äù‚ÄîDavid Grann, New York Times bestselling author of Killers of the Flower Moon
 
 John Grisham is known worldwide for his bestselling novels, but it‚Äôs his real-life passion for justice that led to his work with Jim McCloskey of Centurion Ministries, the first organization dedicated to exonerating innocent people who have been wrongly convicted. Together they offer an inside look at the many injustices in our criminal justice system.
 
 A fundamental principle of our legal system is a presumption of innocence, but once someone has been found guilty, there is very little room to prove doubt. These ten true stories shed light on Americans who were innocent but found guilty and forced to sacrifice friends, families, and decades of their lives to prison while the guilty parties remained free. In each of the stories, John Grisham and Jim McCloskey recount the dramatic hard-fought battles for exoneration. They take a close look at what leads to wrongful convictions in the first place and the racism, misconduct, flawed testimony, and corruption in the court system that can make them so hard to reverse.
 
 Impeccably researched and told with page-turning suspense as only John Grisham can deliver, Framed is the story of winning freedom when the battle already seems lost and the deck is stacked against you.
