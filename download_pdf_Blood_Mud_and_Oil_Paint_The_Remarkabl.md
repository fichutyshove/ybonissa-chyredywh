Overview
Winston Churchill&#039;s impressive military and political career suggests that he had been preparing to lead Great Britain out of the darkness of the Second World War his entire life. Conveniently missing from this rendering of his accomplishments is that, long before his wartime triumph, Churchill failed frequently, publicly, and catastrophically. Author J. Furman Daniel argues that the events of May 1915â€“May 1916 proved the most difficult of all the obstacles the future prime minister would encounter. In this year of defeats, Churchill faced blame for the British disaster at the Dardanelles, resigned from his position as First Lord of the Admiralty, and struggled with policy initiatives and personal finances. Yet during this tumultuous time, Churchill served in the trenches of the First World War, gaining vital insight into modern warfare. He also found unlikely inspiration in painting, which he pursued for the remainder of his life and later credited as a crucial outlet during moments of personal despair and professional frustrations. Together, these experiences aided Churchill&#039;s eventual redemption within the British government and taught him how to weather future career-defining storms. Presenting a deeper understanding of one of the most consequential personalities of the twentieth century, Blood, Mud, and Oil Paint: The Remarkable Year That Made Winston Churchill reveals how the famous statesman rebuilt both his fragile mental state and political career and set the stage for his greatest political comeback.
