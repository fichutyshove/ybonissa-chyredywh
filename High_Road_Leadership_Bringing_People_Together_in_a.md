Overview
Leadership can be a blessing or a curse. It can help people rise up to a better life, or it can cause people to fall into despair. Become part of the solution by becoming a high-road leader.
 
 The world‚Äôs most influential leadership expert, John C. Maxwell, tackles the problem of our divided world in his latest book High Road Leadership. ‚ÄúEverything rises and falls on leadership,‚Äù says Maxwell. ‚ÄúToday it is causing people to fall‚Äîinto disputes, frustration, anger, and despair. His solution is to expose the problems of taking the low and middle roads when interacting with others and teach people how to instead take the high road. Leaders who practice high road leadership value all people, do the right things for the right reasons, take accountability for their actions, and place people above their own agenda. In his trademark communication style, Maxwell teaches the principles and practices of high-road leadership that can increase anyone‚Äôs influence and help them make their world a better place.
