 THE BILLIONAIRE’S FESTIVE REUNION
 A White Christmas in Whistler
 By Cara Colter
 It’s the busiest time of year for billionaire ski resort owner, Brad. After losing his wife, he’s determined to make this festive season memorable. But rescuing his first love, Faith, from a frozen lake isn’t what he had in mind! The passion between them is as potent as ever, but now Brad knows true heartache he’s wary of letting anyone close. Yet the yearning to uncover why Faith ran from him decades earlier is hard to ignore… Can Christmas weave its magic for a snow-kissed second chance?
 
 THEIR MIDNIGHT MISTLETOE KISS
 A White Christmas in Whistler
 By Michele Renae
 Former competitive skier Rayce and no-nonsense ski resort manager Cassandra are polar opposites. So when they’re unexpectedly forced to work together, sparks are sure to fly. Especially since neither has forgotten their almost-kiss ten years ago. And try as they might, they can’t deny their growing desire. But while Rayce is recovering from a career-ending accident and Cassandra’s still reeling from her mum’s death, they can’t fathom anything remotely romance related. Until a sizzling midnight moment under the mistletoe changes everything…
 
 THE TYCOON’S CHRISTMAS DATING DEAL
 By Kandy Shepherd
 The loss of her parents makes working the holidays difficult for event planner Marissa. But planning a party for tycoon Oliver is an offer she can’t refuse. The problem? Oliver—her childhood crush!—needs her to be his fake date… Following his beloved grandfather’s passing, Oliver’s dedicated to giving their family manor the farewell it deserves. But his grieving grandmother is convinced that Marissa is his girlfriend, and why shatter her dreams? Yet as the festivities ramp up, the terms of their deal blur. Is their chemistry real, or just a trick of the twinkle lights?
 
 SWIPE RIGHT FOR MR. PERFECT
 By Justine Lewis
 For art conservationist Laura suffering chronic endometriosis means no relationships. Only, thanks to her interfering mother, she’s matched online with @FarmerDan and can’t bring herself to swipe left… But then she learns ‘Dan’ is really her new boss, Henry, and their attraction is as intense in person as in cyberspace! Being a modern-day duke, Henry’s duty-bound to produce an heir. So while meeting Laura is thrilling, it becomes clear that her condition makes her fertility uncertain. With life pulling them in different directions, is their connection strong enough to flourish offline?
