Overview
Overcome any obstacle life throws at you by thinking and responding like a world-class martial artistâ€”without ever setting foot on the mat.

 Jiu-jitsu is more than a martial art; it is a lifestyle that promotes health, confidence, self-determination, and balance. Famed jiu-jitsu instructor Rener Gracie, who has coached more than 350,000 students in 196 countries, presents the core teachings of jiu-jitsu and explains how they can apply to all of our daily lives, including:
 â€¢ The Pyramid Principle: the importance of investing in a strong foundation
 â€¢ The Acceptance Principle: recognizing when itâ€™s better to yield than to resist
 â€¢ The Pivot Principle: the value of changing your perspective to increase your effectiveness
 â€¢ The Redirection Principle: using unfavorable circumstances to create favorable outcomes

 Intended for both longtime fans and practitioners of jiu-jitsu as well as those completely unfamiliar with martial arts, The 32 Principlesâ€”and 32 companion videos on each principleâ€™s physical application for self-defense from Rener himselfâ€”will help you take control of your personal and professional pursuits, supercharge your entrepreneurial spirit, and balance your relationships at work and at home.

 Along with multi-awardâ€“winning author Paul Volponi, this book features contributions from more than 40 champion athletes, topflight coaches, and others who have benefited from the everyday life applications of these timeless jiu-jitsu principles.
